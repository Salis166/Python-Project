🐍 Python Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Data Analysis Portfolio — a collection of real-world projects where I extract insights from raw data, solve practical problems, and tell stories through clean code and visualizations.

This repository showcases how I use Python, along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks, to:

Explore and clean datasets efficiently

Uncover trends and patterns through statistical analysis

Create meaningful visualizations that drive decisions

Automate repetitive analysis tasks

Communicate insights clearly for non-technical audiences

🔍 What You’ll Find Here:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects

📈 Time series and trend analysis

🧹 Data cleaning and transformation workflows

📌 Real datasets from finance, health, and more

📁 Well-documented notebooks with code, comments, and insights

💡 Why This Matters:

In today’s world, data is only valuable when it's understood. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my ability to bridge raw data and real-world impact using Python.
